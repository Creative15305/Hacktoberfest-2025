## Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PRs may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.

git remote add upstream <https://github.com/allanoguis/hacktoberfest-2024>
You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing:

git remote -v
To pull any new changes from your parent repo, simply run:

git merge upstream/master
This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.

For more information on syncing forks, read this article from GitHub.
